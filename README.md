# TensorizedSpaceTime
A computational platform based on the ideas of Tensor.

This project will use Tensor, as a fundamental building block to create an abstract computing device. Then, using the mathematical principles of Tensor manipulation, to represent the nature of Space and Time.

An important direction was presented to me by Mr. Han Feng. He told me about Yang-Baxter Equation, and the notion of Minimum Entropy. I think his ideas can be useful in defining computation in physical terms, too. I also told him about how to use Tensor as a generic mathematical object for representing space-time.

One of the first few papers I found is the following: https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0401090.pdf. This paper's abstract asserted that 
  "Yang-Baxter equation is a universal gate for quantum computing, in the presence of local unitary transformations."
  
This statement alone shows that Tensorized Space Time as a software project should relate or adopt ideas coming from Yang-Baxter Equation, Quantum Computing, and Miminum Entropy Assumption by Han Feng. However, the minimality could come from a relative scale. Which we will explore in the next few days.
