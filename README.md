# TensorizedSpaceTime
A computational platform based on the ideas of Tensor.

This project will use Tensor, as a fundamental building block to create an abstract computing device. Then, using the mathematical principles of Tensor manipulation, to represent the nature of Space and Time.

An important direction was presented to me by Mr. Han Feng. He told me about Yang-Baxter Equation, and the notion of Minimum Entropy. I think his ideas can be useful in defining computation in physical terms, too. I also told him about how to use Tensor as a generic mathematical object for representing space-time.
